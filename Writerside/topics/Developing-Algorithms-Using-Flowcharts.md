# Developing Algorithms Using Flowcharts
Use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to make flowcharts on a computer.

## Introduction
* Typically, you can't just start coding right away and require to plan.
* You can do this by creating a `flowchart` or by using `pseudocode`.
* Flowcharts are diagrams that use symbols to represent the `flow of the program`.

## Standard Flowchart symbols
: All the symbols needed.

: These are all the flowchart symbols you will need to know.
: Usually in a `decision` you will have a condition inside the box like `is x > y` and then one of the lines out will say `Yes` and the other will say `No`.
: Inside of a `process` you will have some form of `assignment` or `declaration`, like `count ‚Üê count + 1`.

## Identifier names
Just like in the python section, make sure your variables have meaningful variable names.
* Don't call them `x` or `y` as you might forget them. 
* Give them names that will make sense to you like `sum` or `total`.
