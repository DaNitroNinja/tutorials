# GCSE Computing - Algorithms, Decomposition and Abstraction

## What is an Algorithm?
Definitions:
:  An `algorithm` is a series of steps that can be followed to complete a task. It is `not` the same as a `computer program`.
:  A `working algorithm` will always finish and return an answer or perform the task it was supposed to.

Algorithms aren't just in programming. They are everywhere. For example:
* Recipes
* Directions
* Instructions for DIY furniture. 

Here is an example problem
```
How do I make tea?
```
A solution might be 
```
1. Boil water.
2. Put the water into the mug.
3. Get a tea bag and put it into the mug.
4. Stir the tea bag around (if the tea hasn't fully dissolved).
5. Scoop out the tea bag and put it in the bin. 
6. Pour milk in.
7. Add sugar to taste.
```
That is an algorithm as it has steps that allow the person to complete a task.
* There are many ways to create algorithms such as in `flowcharts` and `psuedocode`.
* But we wil be looking at how to `break down the program` and then structure them in the different ways.
 
## Decomposition
When you start programming, your whole program won't be that long and will most likely fit your screen,
but as your programs get more complex, they can quickly become too big and unmanageable.

Definition:
: `Decomposition` is the breaking down of a problem into smaller, simpler steps.

It works by turning a big problem into sub-problems and then into smaller tasks.

Imagine making a game.
You will need to split the game into sub-tasks like:
1. Animations
2. Levels
3. Controls
4. Models

## Computational Thinking

* You need think about how certain problems can be solved by shrinking them into small tasks all of the time.
* If you have a problem like fixing a CCTV system, you need to think about what is wrong and what things you need to fix.

## Abstraction

Definitions:
: `Abstraction` is the process of removing unnecessary details. 
: `Simulations` are the process of finding out what happens under different circumstances using a built model.

Like if you are trying to recognise how many people are in a city square. You won't need to collect data like:
1. Skin colour
2. Gender
3. What accessories the phone has
4. etc..

This is most used in data collection and data science be using `simulations`.

Examples:
: Weather and Climate estimates
: Finance predictions (like the stock market)
: Population models like [Population Pyramid](https:populationpyramid.net)

The best example of abstraction in action is the London Underground map.

: It is good as it removes all unneccessary details.
: You don't need to see the surface or the spot heights that you can get from an OS Map.
