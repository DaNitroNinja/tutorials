# GCSE Python - Input And Output

## Introduction
* One of the most crucial parts of programing is to get user input and give a response back to the user.
* This is very easy in python so this will be a shorter topic.

## Input
* To get user input in python you use the `input()` function that is in-built into python.
* Here are some examples:
```Python
username = input() 
```
* To specify what data type it is put the data type and put the input in it like this:
```Python
userID = int(input()) 
```

## Output
* Once again it is very simple. Use the `print()` method to display and output in the console.
* There are many ways to create an output as in a game an output might be to move the character somewhere.
* Here is an example:
```Python
print("Hello World") 
```
* We can also use variables within a `print()` statement as shown:
```Python
print(string_variable)
```
