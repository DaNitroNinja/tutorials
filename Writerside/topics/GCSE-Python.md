Python Definitions Will Go Here (And Links):

Data Types
: **The following are examples of Data Types**
: Integers (int): Whole numbers (e.g., 42, -15, 0)
: Floats (float): Decimal numbers (e.g., 3.14, -2.5)
: Strings (str): Sequences of characters (e.g., "Hello, world!")
: Booleans (bool): True or False
: Lists: Ordered collections of items (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
: Tuples: Unchangeable lists (cannot be changed after creation)
: [Click here for more info about them.](GCSE-Python-Data-Types.md)

Variables
: **The following are examples of Variables**
: Named containers for storing data values.
: Assigned using = (e.g., age = 25)
: Must start with a letter or underscore, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
: [Click here for more info about them.](GCSE-Python-Variables.md)

Operators
: **The following are examples of Operators**
: Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, // (integer division), % (modulus)
: Comparison: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
: Logical: and, or, not

Input and Output
: **The following are examples of Input and Output**
: Input: Get user input using input() (e.g., name = input("Enter your name: "))
: Output: Print values to the console using print() (e.g., print(name))
: [Click here for more info about them.](GCSE-Python-Input-And-Output.md)

Selection
: **The following are examples of Selection**
: Selection: Change the "flow" of the program by making the code run a different branch 
``` Python
if x > 1:
    # run this line of code
else:
    # run that line of code
```

Iteration
: **The following are examples of Iteration**
: Iteration: Repeat some of the code in the program until a specific condition is met.
: While loop:
``` Python
x = 5
while x != 1:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
print ("The countdown's over!")
```
``` Python
OUTPUT: 
5
4
3
2
1
The countdown's over!
```
: For loop:
``` Python
x = 5
for i in range(0, x)
print(x)
x -= 1
print ("The countdown is over!")
```
:
``` Python
OUTPUT:
5
4
3
2
1
The countdown is over!
```
