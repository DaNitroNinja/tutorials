# Unity C#

## What is Unity?
* Unity is the largest game engine in the world and is the easiest due to the large amount of support available online.
* Unity uses the C# language which is easy to get your head around.

## Where can I learn?
* As of 16/01/2024, there are currently no C# tutorials (except Multiplayer) on this website. They will be added soon.
* Until then, use The C# learn by Microsoft which you can get [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/csharp)

## What about other game engines?
* There are many alternatives such as Unreal Engine and Godot, but I have the most experience with Unity and the C# language.
